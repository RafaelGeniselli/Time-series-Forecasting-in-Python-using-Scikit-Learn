# Time-series-Forecasting-in-Python-using-Scikit-Learn

## *Introduction*
This example is part of [TowardsDataScience]([(https://towardsdatascience.com/]) Database, posted by a user called:Marco Peixoto about a complete guide to time series forecasting using sklearn, pandas and numpy. The goal of this project is to design a framework to frame a time series problem as a supervised learning problem, allowing us to use anu model we want from scikit-learn library.

By the end of this article, you will have the tools and knowledge to apply any machine learning model for time series forecasting along with the statistical models mentioned here.

## *Software and Libraries*
* This project uses Python and the following libraries:
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Statsmodels](https://statsmodels.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
